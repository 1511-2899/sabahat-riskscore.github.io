# Pediatric WES Diagnostic Risk Calculator

This simple web tool estimates the likelihood of a positive genetic diagnosis through whole exome sequencing (WES) in pediatric patients. It uses a logistic regression model based on four key clinical features:

- Age at Onset (<12 months)
- Multi-System Involvement
- Consanguinity
- Diagnostic Delay (>6 months)

Risk is presented as a probability (%) and categorized as Low, Moderate, or High.
